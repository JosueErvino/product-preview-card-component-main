## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have some experience with front-end development from working as a full stack developer on a project, though my background is mostly back-end development. With this project, I managed to play a lot with flexbox and different sizes in the project, trying to align each section of the page with the images available. I'm pretty happy with the results. Also, it's the first time I created something with a mobile-first strategy, and I realise how much easier it is to create the layout and make you app responsive.
